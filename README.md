# ColorRange
A small program to test out Processing 3 for Java. Can show you any combination of rgb colors.

# Summary

* The primary color's value increases from top to bottom and the Secondary color's value increases from left to right. The third color is controlled by the slider.
* The primary color (default green) will be the most prominent in the bottom left while the secondary color (default blue) will be the most prominent in the top right.
* The slider at the bottom of the screen determines how much red, green, or blue each pixel contains.
* The currently selected color will be shown by the color of the slider and can be changed by clicking one of the colored squares in the bottom left.
* Drag the slider the see how adding red, green, or blue would change the gradient
